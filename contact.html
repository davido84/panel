            <h3>About The Victims Panel</h3>
            <p>
                The Seattle King County DUI Victims Panel helps you take responsibility for your actions in a
                non-judgmental forum. We give you the opportunity to hear the stories of real victims of drunk driving,
                giving you a new perspective on your DUI case that you may not get elsewhere in the legal system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our program is non-judgmental and strictly confidential. We understand that everyone makes mistakes.
                Rest assured that we are not here to judge. We are here to help you understand the potential
                consequences of DUI before you are involved in a serious accident.
            <p>
                You may have thought that getting a DUI was the worst thing that could have happened,
                but when you hear the stories of real victims of drunk driving crashes, we hope that you will
                see your DUI as a life-changing experience that will inspire you to change your life for the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is our hope that listening to the stories of real DUI victims will change your life,
                and you will never again drink and drive. We are here to help you reconsider the
                direction that your life is headed, so that you never drink and drive again.
