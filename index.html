                consequences of DUI before you are involved in a serious accident.

                You may have thought that getting a DUI was the worst thing that could have happened,
                but when you hear the stories of real victims of drunk driving crashes, we hope that you will
                see your DUI as a life-changing experience that will inspire you to change your life for the better.
